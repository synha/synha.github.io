Hi.

My name's Viraj, I grew up in San Jose, CA in the heart of Silicon Valley. I recently graduated from Purdue with a degree in CS, specializing in compilers and machine learning, and a triple minor in biology, psychology, and philosophy. I've since never-graduated from [Hacker School](https://www.recurse.com/) (now called Recurse Center) in NYC -- which really gave me a chance to hone my skills and consolidate a lot of what I'd learned during my undergraduate education.

I like to think I'm an aspiring actually-full-stack developer: from transistors all the way up the abstraction to human-computer-interfaces. (This includes the less wide "full stack" of node, js, html...)

I'm interested in a ring of subjects, spanning neuroscience and computer science: how we can build computers which think like the brain, how humans use computers, and how we can use computers to better understand humans and biology. Biology, neuroscience, psychology, user interface design, human computer interaction, software engineering, programming languages, compiler design, genetics, systems biology, and computational neuroscience. With the mother of all science, philosophy, perched in its ivory tower in the middle of this ring, connected to all.

I'm now looking for a way to apply my skills to help teams (of humans) work more effectively: I believe a team is only as good as its tools, and want to build tools for developers to get things done faster and more effectively.
