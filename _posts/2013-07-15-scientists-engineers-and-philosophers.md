title: "Scientists, Engineers, and Philosophers"
---

There's a whirlwind of hate and oneupmanship between philosophers and scientists and engineers regarding who's the best, who's the smartest, and who's the most useful. I'd like to voice some observations in an attempt to unify all three (as they were originally (back in ancient times)).

Generally speaking, engineers use rules developed by the sciences to build things - to push the behavior of nature as we understand it to its utmost limit, usually for the benefit of humanity.

Scientists - again, generally - go about observing encoding the behavior of the universe in math. They experiment on educated hunches, and see what they get. And then they do it again and again and again...

Engineers are sometimes scientists, one good example being finite element analysis of a structure. They're testing an object of nature to see how it behaves. Similarly, scientists are engineers when they build experiments / experimental apparatuses.

Science feeds into engineering, and engineering feeds into science, as the loop they're a part of plunges ever deeper through the realm of what can be discovered.

As they plunge, both science and engineering throw off technological shrapnel (if you will), in the form of new tech, words, ideas, concepts, etc.

Philosophy is *absolutely crucial* to this point, chiefly because we are human. We understand in terms of language, which is much higher level than math (at the expense of a certain particularity). Philosophers integrate the knowledge and 'shrapnel' thrown off in the wake of discovery into our conceptual net. They make sense of the world around us in (admittedly complex terms when new work is being done, but eventually trickles down to) language that we are familiar with. They interconnect concepts which haven't been - and in the process feed back into the science-engineering loop. Without philsophy, science and engineering could probably still lead to new technologies and discoveries, but we'd never truly understand what this *means* for us as a species. I can say X Y Z about n-dimensional hyperspace and we can discuss the latest findings of you-name-it cutting edge field, but we won't understand its implications any higher than the math if it weren't for philosophy.

Science especially has spawned from philosophy, and the 2 are intimately related (although there's a bit of a conflict between the two 'separate' fields in recent years...) Scientists are often philosophers. Traditionally (way back in ancient greece for example), philosophers were scientists. In my opinion, the recent conflict between the two is because we don't have enough philosophers doing science, and a gap has formed between the two in the wake of modern quantum physics. What exactly are the existential implications of the wave particle duality? The observer effect? Or should we be calling it the participator effect? You get the idea.

Engineers are thinkers, yes. But they are primarily builders and creators. Scientists are thinkers, although usually they're experimenters (even theoretical scientists 'play with' ie experiment with new ideas and the math required to support them)

Philosophers are thinkers and integrators, and their realm is higher level (in terms of conceptual abstraction) than that of either scientists or engineers. Usually.
