This weekend, I went with the Purdue Hackers club to MHacks Winter 2014 in Detroit, Michigan. This was the first major hackathon I'd been to, and it was an awesome experience. 

The four person team I was a part of created a hardware and software solution for mobile ordering and checkout which we dubbed Spark. Check out our submission [here](http://mhackswinter2014.challengepost.com/submissions/20159-spark).

We won the "Most Technically Impressive" and "Most Viable Startup" awards!
